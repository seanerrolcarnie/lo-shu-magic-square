# lo-shu-magic-square
This program is used to allow a user to enter a square consisting of 9 numbers. The program determines whether the square is either a regular square, a magic square, or a lo shu magic square. The program uses a simple back-tracking algorithm and two-dimentional arrays, and at this time only contains a text based interface.
Run lo-shu-magic-square.py to run the code.
